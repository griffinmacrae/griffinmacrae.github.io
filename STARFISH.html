				<h1 style="font-size: 20pt;">Overview</h1>
				<p>STARFISH is a bioinspired multilimbed soft robot. A single limb
					prototype is created that consists of the SMA wire actuators, a
					backbone spring-shaped structure to keep the SMAs under load,
					a protective silicone skin, and an electrical interface. Challenges
					inherent to working with SMAs in creating robust mechanical
					and electrical interfaces, as well as providing predictability in
					actuation direction and force, are addressed through the limb
					design, and a baseline characterization of the design
				</p>
				<h1 style="font-size: 20pt;">Design</h1>
				<p>The main three spring designs are shown below along with some of their merits and demerits.
					Additionally,
					a single helix design was also tested. The best option was the double helix because it was a good
					balance
					between flexibility and rigidity. The polywave design was too rigid and limited the flexibility and
					bend of the
					soft limb design. However, the open polywave design was too open and was difficult to keep bent
					straight causing
					it to be much more difficult to be assembled. The double helix spring allows over 90 degrees of
					flexibility and
					returns to its straight upright position easily which is why it was chosen.
				</p>

				<h1 style="font-size: 20pt;">Locomotion</h1>

				<p>The limbs use Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires for locomotion. These wires are
					much lighter than other source of locomotion. They're also more flexible. However, it was
					determined
					that using SMA springs instead of wires is a better design since the total displacement, and
					consquently
					bend, is increased with a spring since it's longer than a straight wire. This can affect the
					displacement from a few percent to over fifty percent of its original size. Four of
					these
					SMA springs are used so the limb can bend in every direction. An excel sheet is attached showing
					the analysis done on the efficiency of SMA springs with different loads and at different voltages.
				</p>
				<h1 style="font-size: 20pt;">Material Selection</h1>
				<p>The selection of the material is important to this project in order for the limb to be compliant
					yet robust. PETG ended up being selected as the best material because it's a good balance
					in between TPU which is too flexible and PLA which is too brittle.
				</p>

				<body>
					<h2>PLA</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Default filament</li>
						<li>Easy to print</li>
						<li>Very very brittle</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>TPU</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>98A is too soft to use with most spring designs</li>
						<li>Desired 75-85D hard to source</li>
						<li>Used for the stiffest design - polywave design</li>
						<li>Absorbs moisture fast - needs to be baked</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>PETG</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Elastic deformation more common than brittle failure</li>
						<li>Absorbs moisture fast - needs to be baked</li>
					</ul>
				</body>

				<h1 style="font-size: 20pt;">Assembly/Manufacturing</h1>
				</p>One of the most important design considerations is simplicity and making the spring able to
				easily be assembled. This is important when working with such small components including SMA wire
				which has a similar diameter to that of a human hair. One way to make it easier to work with this part
				is crimping it to a jumper cable shown in the picture below. Additionally gendered caps were used to
				easily make the different parts of the limb easily go into place. Lastly, nuts were used to adjust and
				fine tune the length of the SMA wires to make sure they're all the same length and it locomotes
				properly.

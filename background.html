                <p>Hello, my name is Griffin MacRae. I'm currently a senior/masters student at the University
                    of Southern California studying Astronautical Engineering (B.S. and M.S.). I have a background
                    in various engineering positions.
                </p>
                <p> I've been working at USC's Space Engineering Research Center
                    (SERC) for over two years. At my time at SERC I've worked on several projects with different
                    roles. I worked on a soft robot (STARFISH) as the lead design engineer designing the limb this
                    robot will use to locomote. This research has since been published. I worked on a genderless
                    docking system called CLINGERS as a mechanical engineer. I worked as a mechanical and assembly
                    engineer working on the safety features NASA gave us. I assembled the flight hardware in a
                    clean room. I also created the MEL and BOM of this 1000+ part assembly. I also created a
                    structure to hold the S-Band electronics for the ground station at USC. I worked on a
                    bioinspired space debris robot as an electronics and controls engineer. I created a schematic
                    for this project in KiCad and did some of the programming for the controls. I also worked on
                    machining an adaptor for a docking system.
                </p>
                <p>I interned at Lockheed Martin where I was an Aeronautical Engineering Intern. I had several
                    responsibilities and worked in a few different fields. I worked in a materials lab looking
                    at novel materials and writing funding proposals. I worked as a part of a GNC team developing
                    an aerodynamic test harness in Simulink to validate aerodynamic data. I also worked as part
                    of a conceptual design team providing high level GNC delivarables to a customer.
